                    <p class="formate">I'm a dedicated Full Stack Web Developer with a strong command of both front-end
                        and back-end technologies. I specialize in creating fast, scalable, and intuitive web
                        applications that deliver real value to users. My workflow balances clean design with robust
                        architecture, allowing me to build everything from dynamic websites to full-featured web
                        platforms.

                        On the front-end, I work with technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), React.js,
                        Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring responsive and user-friendly interfaces. On the back-end,
                        I develop powerful server-side logic using Node.js, Express.js, and handle data with MongoDB,
                        Firebase, and MySQL. I'm also familiar with RESTful APIs, JWT authentication, and version
                        control systems like Git & GitHub.

                        Looking ahead, I'm actively exploring AI integration, machine learning, and cloud services like
                        AWS and Vercel, aiming to bring intelligent, scalable solutions into the products I build. I‚Äôm
                        driven by a love for technology and a passion for continuous learning ‚Äî always ready to take on
                        new challenges and bring ideas to life through code.</p>
